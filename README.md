📌 Hand Gesture Recognition Using OpenCV and Python:

📄 Project Description:
This project aims to develop a real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System using OpenCV and Python. The system captures live video through a webcam, processes the frames to detect a human hand, and identifies specific hand gestures based on shape and finger positioning. 

The program uses image processing techniques such as color filtering, contour detection, and convex hull analysis to isolate the hand and analyze its shape. The number of fingers detected or the specific hand posture can then be mapped to actions—such as controlling a virtual mouse, switching slides, or executing commands.
